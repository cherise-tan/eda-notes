GITIGNORE AND GLOBBING
Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters
- blank lines for spacing
- # marks line as comments
- * matches 0+ characters
- ? matches 1 character
- [abc] matches a, b or c
- ** matches nested directories
--- 'a/**/z matches: a/z || a/b/z || a/b/c/z

Example: 'samples/*.jpg' would allow you to ignore all jpg images within the 'samples' folder
