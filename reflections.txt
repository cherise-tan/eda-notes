COMMAND LINE
In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line allows you to interact with your computer without a graphical user interface, by typing lines of commands (instructions).

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I did not time myself.

Name 5 commands you used and what they do.
mkdir: make a new directory
cd: change directory
touch: create a file
start: open a file
rm: remove a file/folder

Did you learn anything unexpected?
No


VERSION CONTROL
Whats the difference between git and GitHub? Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
Git is version control software that can manage a project's source code history
- It is a tool that is locally installed on your computer
- Allows you to maintain a detailed history of a project and work on different versions of it at the same time
Github is a distributed system that manages multiple copies of git repositories
- It is an online service that stores code pushed to it using the Git tool
- Acts as a social service to enable people to work together more easily on projects

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
No - 24 mins total rather than 65. Due to prior experience with git and github.


GIT
What is a GitHub work flow?
- Create a branch
- Create a commit
-- use GIT ADD to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index
- Open a pull request
- Merge

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
Not noticed much as yet as this is primarily revision.

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
No
