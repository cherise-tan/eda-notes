MANIPULATING ARRAYS
.push: append to end of array
.unshift: append to start of array
.pop: remove from end of array
.shift: remove from start of array

ARGUMENTS VS PARAMETERS
ARGUMENTS are specified to the function as part of the function call
PARAMETERS act as placeholders for the values that are input to a function when it is called

e.g. 	sayHello(name) { 
	   alert(name); 
	};		
	sayHello("cherise")

- cherise is an argument
- name is an argument

ARRAYS AND OBJECTS
Arrays: use indexes to access and modify data
Objects: use properties
- useful for storing data in a structured way

Can access object properties using . or [] notation
- . when you know the name of the property you are accessing
- [] needs to be used if the property has a space in its name

Deleting from an object
- delete object.value;

Check if object has a particular propertyy
- object.hasOwnProperty
